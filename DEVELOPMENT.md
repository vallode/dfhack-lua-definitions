# Development

The library is partially automatically generated, with the aim of eventually becoming fully automated.

Files generated by the script ([`generate.rb`](src/generate.rb)) are marked as such on their first line. Those files should never be edited by hand as any changes will be lost when the script is next ran.

Once set up, you can follow the normal "installation" instructions, but simply point the language server at the [dist](dist) folder.

Structure files are output to the base [dist](dist) directory, only the [base.lua](dist/library/base.lua) file is meant to be manually edited.
