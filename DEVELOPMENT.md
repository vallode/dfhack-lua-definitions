# Development

The library is partially automatically generated, with the aim of eventually becoming fully automated.

Files generated by the script ([`generate.rb`](src/generate.rb)) are marked as such on their first line. Those files should never be edited by hand as any changes will be lost when the script is next ran.

The script depends on a copy of [df-structures](//github.com/DFHack/df-structures) being located somewhere accessible.

Once set up, you can follow the normal "installation" instructions, but simply point the language server at the [dist](dist) folder.

## Status

Lots of manual work can be done on the non-df-structures definitions
(like `common.lua`) in order to boost coverage of the core dfhack lua library.

- [ ] `<struct-type>` `is-union` parsing
- [ ] Head start on parsing the c++ modules
